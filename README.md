# Psychic-Game

## Description 
This is a JavaScript game in which the computer will choose a letter from the alphabet and the user will then press keys to guess what the letter is. The user will have 9 tries to guess the letter correctly. Incorrect guesses will display on the page and the number of remaining guesses will decrease. If the user is not able to guess the letter in 9 tries the number of losses will increment and the display will update. If the user guesses the letter correctly, the number of wins will increment and the display will update. The computer then chooses a new letter and the number of guesses remaining resets to 9 and the incorrect guesses are cleared.
